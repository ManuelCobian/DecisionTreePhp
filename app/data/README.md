# ID3-PHP
Inductive inference using decision tree learning algorithm ID3 in PHP

This simple program implements the ID3 algorithm as prescribed by the Chapter 3 of Machine Learning, Tom M. Mitchell, McGraw Hill, 1997 (also provided in PDF).

The program reads the data.csv file to generate the decision tree.  Then, it applies the decision process to input_data.csv to predict an outcome.

### Files needed
dec_tree3.php   : Main program.   
data.csv        : Training data.   
input_data.csv  : Predictors

### Use
php dec_tree3.php

### NOTE
This is by no mean a scholar project.  Just playing around.
